# Bria Yoga Website

A one-page website for Bria, a certified yoga teacher focused on accessible, body-aware yoga practices. This project was created as both a personal gift and a professional learning exercise.


## Purpose
To give Bria a professional digital home and help her transition toward private yoga instruction. The site highlights her teaching philosophy: mindfulness, compassion, and accessibility for all bodies.


## Features (MVP)
- Semantic, mobile-first HTML5 structure
- Clean vertical scroll layout with calm, minimalist sections
- Responsive CSS with focus on readability and whitespace
- FAQ and contact form (static for now)
- Placeholder hero and imagery for later customization

## Credits & Tools
- **AI Design Assistance:** The initial design prompt for the Bria Yoga website was developed with help from ChatGPT (OpenAI) to clarify structure and content flow.
- **Visual Mockup:** A concept mockup was generated using Gamma (https://gamma.app) to guide layout decisions.
- **Code:** All HTML, CSS, and JS were written by me from scratch for learning and development practice.

## ✏️ Design AI Prompt Used

> Design a one-page website for a yoga teacher named Bria who specializes in gentle, accessible yoga for all bodies. The website should feel calm, minimalist, and rooted in nature.  
>
> **Sections to include:**  
> Hero Section: “Rooted in Grace, Moved by Breath” — subheadline: “No perfection required, just presence.” Include a calm background image (studio, nature, or texture).  
>  
> About Section: photo of Bria and short paragraph about her philosophy of accessible yoga and mindfulness.  
>  
> Offerings Section: four yoga styles — Hatha, Vinyasa, Iyengar, and Yin. Mention $160/month for four 90-minute private sessions.  
>  
> FAQs Section: three to four common questions about yoga experience, session structure, and accessibility.  
>  
> Contact Form Section: name, email, phone, and open-ended questions about goals, experience, and accessibility needs. Include a line at the bottom: “Your information is kept private and used only to connect with you about yoga sessions.”  
>  
> Footer: “© 2025 Bria Yoga • Designed with care by a friend.” Include an Instagram icon link.  
>  
> **Design Keywords:** grounded, serene, airy, inclusive, approachable, elegant simplicity.  
>  
> **Layout Preference:** vertical scroll, centered sections, soft rounded edges, clear buttons.  
>  
> The tone should make visitors feel calm, welcomed, and supported. Include space for gentle photography and quotes about breath and presence. The overall design should feel like a sanctuary — not a sales page.

## Notes
This version was reconstructed after Chromebook data loss in November 2025.  
Earlier iterations were lost before upload to GitHub, so this README serves as documentation for the rebuild.
